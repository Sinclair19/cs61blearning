# 1 Introduction to Java
## 1 Essentials
Java is an object oriented language with strict requirements  
1. All code in Java must be part of a class
2. We delimit hte beginning and end of segments of code with { }
3. All staements in Java must end in a semi-colon
4. For code to run we need `public static void main(String[] args){}`

statically typed  
1. Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared
2. Java variables must have a specific type
3. Java variable types can never change
4. In java, types are verified before the code runs! If there are type issues, the code will not compile

1. All parameters of a function must have a type, and the function itself must have a return type
2. All functions must be part of a clss, In programming language terminology, a function that is part of a class is called a "method", so all fucntions in Java are methods

A sequence of two programs to run a Java program  
- `javac` to compile the code
- `java` to run it
